# E-Commerce-Analysis
This project focuses on extracting and analyzing data from an e-Commerce database to generate insights that can help steer business decisions by analyzing marketing channels, measuring website performance, and exploring the product portfolio

# Traffic Analysis & Optimization
I used MySQL to analyze where website traffic was coming from, evaluated how different sources performed in terms of traffic volume and conversion rates, and adjusted bids to optimize budgets.

# Website Measurement & Testing
I dived into page-level website data to compare traffic and conversion rates. I built and analyzed conversion funnels using MySQL to optimize the customer purchase experience.

# Channel Analysis & Optimization
I dug deeper into the traffic channel mix, explored paid vs. free traffic, and broke down performance by device type. Advanced SQL queries were written to conduct time-series analyses, allowing me to understand trending and seasonality.

# Product-Level Analysis
MySQL was used to break down product-level sales and conversion rates, analyze cross-selling patterns, and monitor refund rates to keep a pulse on quality.

# User-Level Analysis
I closely examined user behavior and repeat sessions. MySQL data analysis techniques were applied to identify the most valuable customers and explore which channels they were coming from.
